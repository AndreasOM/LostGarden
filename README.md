# LostGarden Graphics

Daniel Cook (http://www.lostgarden.com/) provides a nice set of graphics to get indy developers started.

In true artists style the naming and layout of the files is a true mess.

This is a cleaned up version, which might be of help to you ... or it may not.

Work in progress!
Might change at any time.

I only work on this around 15 minutes every day during my lunchbreaks,
so it might take a while until it's finished.

And yes, in some cases the cut could be much tighter, but I want to get through all of them once
before I start to optimize.
